# foo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of foo is to showcase how to create a simple R package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of foo from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ramiromagno/foo")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of what my package can do right now, which is not much!

```{r example}
library(foo)

is_odd(1)

is_odd(2)
```
